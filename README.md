 # Internship Project : Flight Price Prediction
# Context
Flight ticket prices are highly variable and often unpredictable, fluctuating due to factors like demand, time of booking, seasonality, and more. For passengers, this can make it difficult to determine the best time to book, while airlines face the challenge of pricing tickets optimally to maximize both accessibility and profit. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict flight ticket prices based on a variety of factors, helping airlines and passengers make more informed decisions.

# The Problem
With so many variables influencing flight prices, accurately predicting them is complex but valuable. Machine learning models can help airlines forecast prices, which may improve revenue management, enable targeted marketing strategies, and offer price transparency. This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate flight ticket prices based on various attributes such as airline, route, number of stops, and travel duration. This model could ultimately contribute to more consistent and data-driven pricing strategies in the aviation industry.

# Impact
Accurately predicting flight ticket prices benefits both airlines and passengers. Airlines can optimize pricing strategies to balance affordability with revenue goals, while passengers gain insights into expected costs, helping them make better booking decisions. Additionally, this model can serve as a foundation for future enhancements, such as real-time dynamic pricing algorithms that respond to market changes.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

# Data Analysis: 
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the impact of various features on flight ticket prices.
Feature Engineering: Extract and engineer relevant features from date, time, and categorical columns to improve prediction accuracy.
# Predictive Modeling: 
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a flight based on the available features.
Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using suitable metrics, such as mean absolute error or root mean square error, to ensure reliable predictions.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of several columns that capture key details about each flight. Here’s an overview of each feature:

1. Airline: This column specifies the airline operating the flight, such as Indigo, Jet Airways, Air India, and others. This feature could significantly impact price due to variations in services and brand value among airlines.
2. Date_of_Journey: This feature represents the date when the journey begins, which can be crucial since prices often vary by season, day of the week, and how far in advance the booking is made.
3. Source: This is the departure location of the passenger's journey. It can influence price due to airport fees, demand, and location-specific factors.
4. Destination: This is the arrival location where the passenger intends to travel. Destination-related factors like demand and connectivity may affect the price.
5. Route: This feature shows the route chosen for travel from the source to the destination. Different routes (e.g., direct vs. multi-stop) can vary in price.
6. Arrival_Time: This indicates the time the flight is scheduled to arrive at the destination, which can influence price as flights at peak or off-peak hours might have different pricing.
7. Duration: This column captures the total travel time from source to destination. Flights with longer durations or layovers may have different pricing structures.
8. Total_Stops: This represents the number of stops the flight makes. Generally, direct flights cost more, whereas flights with layovers or stops tend to be cheaper.
9. Additional_Info: This column provides information on amenities, such as in-flight food, entertainment, and other services, which can affect ticket pricing.
10. Price (Target): This is the target variable, representing the total price of the flight, including all expenses prior to boarding.
